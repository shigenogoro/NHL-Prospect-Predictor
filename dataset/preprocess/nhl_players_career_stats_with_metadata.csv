He was 20 when he came to the NHL and immediately established himself as one of the most punishing body-checkers in professional hockey. He was extremely unpopular with opponents, who could be seen emerging from encounters in the corners with Kasparaitis in a state of sheer rage. During his career, the hard-hitting Kasparaitis has suffered at least as much pain as he has inflicted on others. A strong skater who mostly concentrated on the defensive side of the game, Kasparaitis had an infectious enthusiasm for the game. He left the NHL in 2007 and played two more seasons for SKA St. Petersburg in the KHL before retiring as a professional player. But after four years without official hockey games he came back. In 2013 he made his formal transfer back to Lithuania and joined the Hockey Punks Vilnius. He has played four consecutive seasons in the top Lithuanian league. In his playing days he was known as a big spender, blowing his high paychecks on clothes and cars and nights out. But he has settled down and started his own real estate development company.

In 1992 during the split up he stayed with the Russian system, won Olympic gold with the ""Unified Team"", he represented Russia in the World Championship as he did in 1996, at three more Olympic Winter Games (1998, 2002, 2006) and the 2004 World Cup of Hockey.",52

He was a tricky stickhandler who protected the puck well but he lacked explosiveness in his skating to really surprise defenses. He did have a penetrating shot but too often he shot from too far out. Defensively he struggled with consistency but shook off early-career criticisms to be an average player without the puck. His poor face-off proficiency was a concern, however.
Overall, Arnason was a skilled center with good vision and offensive ability, but would consistently fail to show discipline and motivation in order to really make it as a professional hockey player.

Sven Andrighetto is an offensive forward with very good speed. Owns strong offensive instincts and has a nose for the net.

Andrighetto plays a reliable two-way game and competes hard for the puck at both ends of the ice.

An electric offensive presence on the ice, Casey Mittelstadt brings the complete package of speed, skill, and hockey sense. He competes hard with every shift, and has the dynamic puck skills to keep up with his creativity, which is a hallmark of his game. His awareness is all-encompassing, and he never puts his teammates in positions where their time and space will be bottlenecked. Bigger players don't phase him, as he thinks the game analytically and will find chinks in the opposition's armor on the fly. As a result, Mittelstadt is often seen forcing more complicated plays that the opposition won't be able to read in time. On top of all this, he can play a north-south game, and his transition game is already at an elite level. He's a complete player with the predatory instincts necessary to succeed as a consistent and, perhaps, dominant point producer at the next level.",26

Offensively, he can be uncontainable, consistently displaying excellent vision and individual puck skills; can act as both the passer or the shooter in any given situation. An all-around game, rooted in his strong will to win and his ability to make the players around him better, is what he brings each and every night.

His mobility is all but elite at this point; he primarily uses his speed to open up passing and shooting lanes in the offensive zone. With and without the puck he stays composed and in-position, allowing him to analyze situations effortlessly and make those calculated decisions. Defensively, he is assertive and, though he isn't able to impose himself physically, he uses his vision and quickness to take away options and put pressure on the opposition. He plays a structured game offensively, and he does the little things right. His ability to recognize where the puck is, where it is going to be, and why it is going to be there is an indicator of his high-level hockey sense. When you put together skill, speed, and excellent decision-making as well as he does, that translates to on-ice productivity and power-play time. All-in-all, Nicolas Beaudin is an offensive defenceman that understands his own game well and ever seeks to expand upon his strengths.",25

Josh Anderson is a two-way forward with a rare combination of size and quickness. Possesses excellent foot-speed and has tremendous acceleration. With that asset he plays the game with very good drive and uses his speed to be an effective fore-checker and completes his hits well. Handles the puck well, granting puck-control is average, as he loves to dump the puck and chase it, instead of going 1-on-1 with a stickhandle-move. Has a nose for the net and creates scoring-chances for him and his teammates, although he is not known for his finishing-qualities. His speed, physical play and willingness to go to the front of the net and to the corners makes him the perfect player in a middle-6 role and can be used in all situations.",31

He brings versatility, being able to play as a center or a winger, as well as elite skill and agility. His athleticism is exemplified in his strong skating that allows him to backcheck hard, explode up the ice in-transition, or propel himself up into hits that opponents won't soon forget. His defensive zone play is excellent; he proactively finds and takes away shooting and passing lanes, and makes it tough on opponents to pinpoint any daylight. When he is on the ice, he is uncontainable and leads the forecheck; he creates the time and space for himself to be creative with the puck and finds a way to get it to the back of the net. He makes the players around him better, serving as an example of what hard work and skill can and will be able to produce.

A similarly punishing two-way forward with size and zero deficiencies, Anze Kopitar, is the type of player Dubois will aspire to become at the next level. Pierre-Luc Dubois has the potential to develop into an elite two-way forward who excels as a positive catalyst in every facet of the roles he can play, be it the dynamic scorer, the set-up man, the intimidating power forward, or the defensive-minded shutdown guy.

Not soon after, Nazarov moved to North America, which suited his style more than in the skill-dominated Russian league. Nazarov did not become an NHL regular right away and he had to spend a few seasons splitting his time between San Jose and Kansas City. But once Nazarov established himself as an NHL player, his presence was certainly felt all throughout the league. He developed into perhaps the best Russian enforcer the NHL has seen. Never shy to give his opinion, or drop his gloves, he was also no stranger to the penalty box. Nazarov played a pure Canadian game, and the Russians were proud to have someone in the league who did not fit the typical ""Euro-soft"" player stereotype.
In 2004, he returned to Russia where he played for Metallurg Novokuznetsk and Avangard Omsk. On and off-ice incidents, however, forced him back to North America where he skated three more games.
His retirement came shortly after claims from Nazarov that a large number of NHL players use performance-enhancing drugs. Realizing the consequences of his comments, he accepted his fate and retired.

Internationally, he represented Russia in 1998 World championship. After retirement he became succesful coach, both on club and international level. His hot-tempered personality is still present and Nazarov had several conflicts even as a coach.",51

Even so, there were warning signs. Hulbig played just 17 games of high school hockey in his draft year – a shoulder injury knocked him out of the lineup – and that represented two problems. The first was that Hulbig didn’t play very much, reducing the number of times scouts could see him. The second was that Hulbig was playing at a terrible level, making judgement difficult. He was slated for college hockey, joining Providence following the draft.

Almost immediately, the Oilers must have known there was a problem. In his first year at Providence, Hulbig scored just three times and finished with 16 points in 26 games. Hulbig did pick up the pace eventually, scoring at the point-per-game level over his final two seasons. He’d earn a few NHL cups of coffee over the ensuing years thanks to strong play in the minors. The problem, though, was that he was essentially finished developing offensively at the age of 23.

On November 9, 2000 he suffered a career-threatening head injury. During his recovery, it was also determined that nagging abdominal injuries required significant surgery. He eventually came back, but never returned to NHL, finishing his career in the minors being only 31 years old.",51

He broke out as a top-notch offensive defenseman in his second season and followed that up with several seasons of high offensive production, including six straight seasons of 30 or more points. Despite his immense talent, Gonchar never won a Norris Trophy as the NHL’s best defenseman; the closest he ever got was finishing fourth in voting three times.

Overall, Gonchar was an offensively skilled defenseman with an excellent eye for the game. A good skater with good stickhandling. Had a good opening pass and was generally a good passer. He was a lethal weapon on the power play, a world class player and also played sound defense. With a devastating wrist shot and smooth skating skills, he liked to shoot from the blue line, but he was never very physical player.

Gonchar is a two-time Olympic medal-winner with Russia. He earned a silver medal at the 1998 Olympic Games and a bronze medal at the 2002 Olympic Games. In addition, Gonchar also competed in the 1993 World Junior Championship, two World Cups and three World Championships.",51

While he doesn't aim to impress, he does all of the little things right and plays with an edge. The neutral zone is his launching pad: he is able to take off into the offensive end, or backcheck quickly into his own end. Very sound positionally. Smooth skater with lots of energy to burn. Not afraid to lay the body, or take a hit to make the play; can and will stand up for teammates. Possesses good hands and awareness on the ice, as well as a hard shot that is quite accurate. All-in-all, a complete defenseman that is relied upon to offset any oncoming attacks, as well as create chances in the opposing end. (Curtis Joe, EP 2015)

Could end up being that home-run pick in the 2015 NHL Draft. Few holes in his game. A low-risk, high-reward type of player. Reminiscent style of play to that of NHL D-man Keith Yandle. [EP]

Alexei Kovalev is a world class stick- and puck-handler. Can easily beat defenders in tight space with his terrific one-on-one moves in combination with his great and smooth skill-set. He is an elegant skater, but has lost a step or two over the years, although he’s still moves forward in an effective way. His wrist shot is hard and accurate and Alexei Kovalev has excellent vision and playmaking abilities. He knows exactly which games count and which not; however, critics have questioned his work ethic throughout his career.",52

He was better defensively than some people gave him credit for, yet he was not as good offensively as some believed. He had a good shot and made smart first pass, but was never an overly creative offensive player. He became an in-demand player as a veteran because of his savvy and calm play. He would often be brought into a new team to play a leader's role and help young prospects like he once was.

Defensively, he’s uncomfortable having the puck in his own end for long and he’ll make the extra effort to pressure around the blue line and take away cross-ice options. Upon procuring puck possession, he’ll be the first to explode up ice in-transition. The hallmark of his game is his exceptional goal-scoring ability. He has a shot that absolutely leaps off his stick with pinpoint accuracy when he lets loose and a low centre of gravity that facilitates fast and flashy puckhandling at pace.

He affords his linemates options by taking advantage of any allotted attention he garners, generating time and space by drawing guys in; he’s perpetually hard to play against.

He is an undeniably good finisher, but could stand to be a bit quicker with his passes. Defensively his two-way game shines as he reads the opposition ahead of the play and positions himself well to get in passing and shooting lanes. He proactively transitions to offence quickly and uses his speed to give himself time and space. Exceptional decision making stands out as a big part of what makes him successful in many roles.

An excellent skater who displays consistent agility. Tremendous release on his shot, but can get caught thinking instead of doing. Transition game is elite, and his quickness at switching from defence to offence is so abrupt that it catches a lot of players off-guard. The work ethic, talent, and hockey sense is all there, but the biggest thing is that McCann needs to be more confident in his abilities. When he is on his game he can be dominant, and when he is offensively and defensively assertive, he is near impossible to stop. As he continues to grow into more prominent roles, he will develop more upward-trending habits and become more consistent.

He stickhandles really well through traffic. Offensively his passing skills are superb. His flip passes are perhaps a bit risky, His shot is decent, although it can and should be improved, and although he is still more of a playmaker than a scorer, he has a pretty good scoring touch.

Defensively Bäckström takes care of his responsibilities and is a rather good penalty killer. He could use some work on his conditioning and skating.

Krivokrasov was a solid and sometimes spectacular player but continued to tantalize with flashes of brilliance.
With his NHL career at a standstill, Krivokrasov returned to Russia for the 2002-03 season. He never returned to NHL and Krivokrasov's final few seasons in the Russian league would be nomadic as he appeared for 5 clubs between 2004 and 2008.

His ability to finish and create plays is undoubtedly the hallmark of his game, as he is one of the major dynamos of his draft class. He is a dangerous scoring threat anywhere below the blue line and his vision matched with his net-drive propels him into positions that create high percentage opportunities.

Cousins: Oliver Lindholm, Elias Lindholm

A very skilled center that will get the job done on the wing as well. Järnkrok's main asset is his outstanding hockey sense, which allows him to be the great playmaker that he is. Overall a very smart player with good positioning in all zones. Also quite shifty with soft hands and impressive puckhandling skills. Not a physical player, but plays pretty well through heavy traffic although in need of gaining strength and muscles. Good character. Often used as pointman on the man advantage, but can still improve his release. Is a good skater, but there is still some room for improvement in that department.",33

Smith made his NHL debut with the Devils in the 1993-94 season, but missed the majority of the next season because of a knee injury. then moved up to the NHL for good, playing with the Devils until 1997 when he was dealt to the Maple Leafs. After a few years in Toronto, Smith was traded to the Oilers in 1999 and settled in to his new club, becoming the captain.

Known more for his gritty play, Smith continued to be one of the teams leaders both on and off the ice. He was always ready to drop the gloves and stand up for his teammates, although he was not a heavyweight fighter. He was never a top scorer, but his presence in a locker room was very important. Following a year away from NHL hockey due to the lock out year, Smith would lead a surprising Oiler team as captain into the NHL Stanley Cup Finals in 2006. Last two seasons of his career he spent in Philadelphia and Ottawa.

Aside from his World Junior gold medal experience, Smith has gone on to represent his homeland at 2001 World Championships.",51

He is a smooth, shifty skater that traverses all three zones with ease and closes the gap on the backcheck quickly. Defensively, his understanding of the game communicates itself through his proactive positioning and an active, lane-disrupting stick. Willing to go to the dirty areas and fight for the puck, but isn't at his best there.

Offensively, below the opposition's blue line, he is an electric, dominant force that showcases excellent decision-making and undeniable puck skills. He's aggressive, but never takes stupid penalties that will put his team in disadvantage state. Krebs' hockey sense is on full display when he's making moves, creating space, and orchestrating opportunities for himself and linemates.

He was an offensively productive centreman whose style of play was well suited to international hockey. Had plenty of creativity and fine hands. After the draft, Petrovicky moved across the Atlantic to try his hand at North American style hockey. His transition, however, fell far short of expectations. Over the decade that followed, he never played in one place for an entire season. His NHL stints were usually annual but brief in nature. In essence, he was unable to adapt his scoring touch to the NHL level. He was useful to teams in a pinch, but otherwise he was, for the most part, a minor-league call-up. After his return to Europe he played in many countries including Swtzerland, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Czech republic and Slovakia. Overall he was a great leader and often named captain. He was the last former Hartford Whalers player active in professional hockey.

He played in three Olympic games and five World Championships, winning gold medal in 2002.

He tried to have his contract renegotiated three times in five years when he played with the Senators. He sat out the 1998-99 season over a contract dispute. He became the first Russian to be the full-time captain of an NHL team. He spent 12 seasons in NHL and moved back to Russia in 2007 after being bought out of the Islanders contract, where he continued his career. Even after retirement in 2012, he was still being paid by Islanders until 2015. In December 2012, he was appointed to the post of general manager of the Russian National Women's Team.

On the international stage, the former first rounder is a two-time member of Russia's Olympic team (1998 and 2002), a seven-time member of its World Championship team (1993, 1994, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2004 and 2005), two-time member of its World Junior team (1992, 1993) and a two-time member of its World Cup team.",51

He had a style that was somewhat reckless, but he managed to avoid getting battered by the bigger bodies in the NHL for the most part and became one of the Penguins' most prolific players of all time. After leaving NHL in 2008, he came back to Czech republic and served six more seasons as the captain of HC Plzen, the team where he was also a franchise owner and general manager. In 2013 he celebrated the Czech title. After retiring, he quickly moved into a coaching position. figure and Penguins all-star.

The tall and strong defenseman has a unique combination of size and speed. He accelerates very well and at full speed there are few, if any, defenseman of such stature that can match Hedman. Furthermore, he has very good hockey sense which contributes to him usually being at the right place at the right moment.

Hedman’s puck skills are above average and he is very good at moving the puck into the offensive end in high speed. He is also quite shifty and creative and can stickhandle through heavy traffic. Offensively, he has a good shot, including a heavy slapper that he could, however, use more frequently. His passing game is also of high caliber.

As for his defensive game, he does not really play very physical. He is an aggressive player with an edge to his game, but likes to solve tricky situations with his hockey sense and stick work, rather than playing the body. His reach is impressive and provides him with a natural advantage over his opponents. What really characterizes Hedman as a player, beside the obvious combination of size, skill and speed, is his attitude, winner’s instinct and the urge to be the best at what he does.",34

Natural size and strength compliment his smooth stride. Very mobile skater who moves up and down the ice quickly, with acute recognition of puck and body position. His maturity and poise is actualized in his high-percentage decision-making, with and without the puck, as well as his proactive stick and body play. Very stable defensively and always takes his lane, but is quick to rush the puck up the ice as he recognizes and accounts for how much time his team is spending in their own end.

The Russian Rocket was one of the fastest skaters and greatest goal scorers to ever touch the ice. Bure won gold at the World Juniors and World Championship and set the WJC tournament record with 27 goals in 21 games. He won the Calder Trophy in 1992 with 34 goals and 60 points in 65 games and followed up with 2 straight 60-goal seasons, the latter of which led the NHL. Bure helped lead the Canucks to the 1994 Cup Finals with 16 goals and 31 points in the playoffs but fell short in a 3-2 Game 7 loss. After 51 goals in 1998, he was traded to the Panthers, where he won back-to-back Maurice Richard Trophies with 58 goals in 2000 and 59 in 2001.

Next season he played the majority of the year with the Fredericton Canadiens of the AHL while also making his NHL debut, appearing in one game with Montreal Canadiens. The following season, he split time with Fredericton and Montreal. The 1996–97 season saw Wilkie make the Montreal Canadiens full-time, appearing in 61 games and scoring 15 points, both NHL career highs.

He was then traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning, but injuries would hamper Wilkie in his time with the new team. After two miserable seasons he signed with the New York Rangers, but again ended up playing the majority of the time in the minors.

For the 2001–02 season, Wilkie signed with the Augusta Lynx of the ECHL as a player-coach. After one season with the Lynx, Wilkie retired as a player in 2002. Since then he works as a coach mainly for junior teams.",51

Yzerman was fantastic one-on-one with defensemen, using his terrific stickhandling skills and tremendous skating abilities. Had a laser of a shot, and was an awesome playmaker and passer.

Once a pure offensive force, Scotty Bowman turned him into an outstanding two-way center and an amazing defensive forward as well. To achieve this, Yzerman had to sacrifice a lot of personal stats and instead improve the team.

A quiet player, Yzerman is famous for his ""lead-by-example"" style of leadership.",60

He's a hard-nosed workhorse that makes the players around him better. The fleet-footed center is unselfish and will primarily look to make a play at top speed; however, when the chance arises to put it in the pot himself, he will capitalize. He sees the ice well and is rarely caught out of position. His defensive game is refined and he actively pursues puck control. Transitioning to offence is natural, smooth, and quick. All-in-all, a well-rounded two-way forward that skates well and can be the catalyst a team needs to turn a game in its favor. If he can find the consistency in refusing to let himself get taken out of plays, especially if he doesn't start them, he will thrive and exceed expectations.",25
