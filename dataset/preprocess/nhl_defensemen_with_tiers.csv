He was 20 when he came to the NHL and immediately established himself as one of the most punishing body-checkers in professional hockey. He was extremely unpopular with opponents, who could be seen emerging from encounters in the corners with Kasparaitis in a state of sheer rage. During his career, the hard-hitting Kasparaitis has suffered at least as much pain as he has inflicted on others. A strong skater who mostly concentrated on the defensive side of the game, Kasparaitis had an infectious enthusiasm for the game. He left the NHL in 2007 and played two more seasons for SKA St. Petersburg in the KHL before retiring as a professional player. But after four years without official hockey games he came back. In 2013 he made his formal transfer back to Lithuania and joined the Hockey Punks Vilnius. He has played four consecutive seasons in the top Lithuanian league. In his playing days he was known as a big spender, blowing his high paychecks on clothes and cars and nights out. But he has settled down and started his own real estate development company.

In 1992 during the split up he stayed with the Russian system, won Olympic gold with the ""Unified Team"", he represented Russia in the World Championship as he did in 1996, at three more Olympic Winter Games (1998, 2002, 2006) and the 2004 World Cup of Hockey.",52,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,5.0,1992.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3

Girard required surgery for a broken pelvis and to remove fluid from his lungs. While at the time it was not known if Girard would ever play hockey again, he showed tremendous resilience in returning to skating at the Bruins' practice facility in Wilmington, Massachusetts in March, 2004. However, the loss of the 2004–05 NHL season due to a lockout nullified his attempt at a return to hockey that year. Girard played one game with Providence in the AHL on October 15, 2005, before returning to Quebec to consult with his doctors. On November 30, Girard announced his decision to retire, having fully recovered from his injuries but unable to play professional hockey again.",45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.0,48.0,1998.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4

He broke out as a top-notch offensive defenseman in his second season and followed that up with several seasons of high offensive production, including six straight seasons of 30 or more points. Despite his immense talent, Gonchar never won a Norris Trophy as the NHL’s best defenseman; the closest he ever got was finishing fourth in voting three times.

Overall, Gonchar was an offensively skilled defenseman with an excellent eye for the game. A good skater with good stickhandling. Had a good opening pass and was generally a good passer. He was a lethal weapon on the power play, a world class player and also played sound defense. With a devastating wrist shot and smooth skating skills, he liked to shoot from the blue line, but he was never very physical player.

Gonchar is a two-time Olympic medal-winner with Russia. He earned a silver medal at the 1998 Olympic Games and a bronze medal at the 2002 Olympic Games. In addition, Gonchar also competed in the 1993 World Junior Championship, two World Cups and three World Championships.",51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,14.0,1992.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,1

Not afraid to lay the body, or take a hit to make the play; can and will stand up for teammates. Possesses good hands and awareness on the ice, as well as a hard shot that is quite accurate. All-in-all, a complete defenseman that is relied upon to offset any oncoming attacks, as well as create chances in the opposing end. (Curtis Joe, EP 2015)

Could end up being that home-run pick in the 2015 NHL Draft. Few holes in his game. A low-risk, high-reward type of player. Reminiscent style of play to that of NHL D-man Keith Yandle. [EP]

Keeps his game simple, by not risking too much and always looking to make a short safe pass. Needs to improve his shot, despite most of the time being on target, his release is poor and it lacks power. Has fine hands and puck handling and his passes are soft and accurate, but like his shot they lack power. Stands his ground along the boards and is not afraid to use his body, while playing a reliable defensive game.",28,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.0,57.0,2015.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4

Plays with poise and composure through high pressure situations and, with the puck on his stick, can direct the play up-ice. Exhibits a particularly potent shot that works its magic on the power play and on the forecheck. Excellent first pass and uses his vision and awareness to keep the puck moving in the direction of the opposition's tail or to a teammate with more time and space. Defensively adept at tracking the puck and staying a step ahead of the opposition. Proactive with his stick and body, exerting pressure on the opposition and forcing them to make hurried decisions.

All-in-all, a well-rounded two-way defender who competes with pro-level drive and makes his authoritative presence felt at both ends of the ice.",27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1.0,16.0,2016.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2

He was not typical blue line big man. He had no mean streak and he was never going put a guy into the first row with thunderous bodychecks. He was very strong, able to handle top power forwards. But the strength of his game was his surprising skating ability, blessed with mobility and a burst of speed. Combined with excellent positioning Rathje could keep up with the top speedsters. Unfortunately, Rathje's career was cut short by chronic hip and back problems. He never officially retired and spent 2007 to 2010 on the Flyers' long-term injured reserve list.",51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,3.0,1992.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3

Smith made his NHL debut with the Devils in the 1993-94 season, but missed the majority of the next season because of a knee injury. then moved up to the NHL for good, playing with the Devils until 1997 when he was dealt to the Maple Leafs. After a few years in Toronto, Smith was traded to the Oilers in 1999 and settled in to his new club, becoming the captain.

Known more for his gritty play, Smith continued to be one of the teams leaders both on and off the ice. He was always ready to drop the gloves and stand up for his teammates, although he was not a heavyweight fighter. He was never a top scorer, but his presence in a locker room was very important. Following a year away from NHL hockey due to the lock out year, Smith would lead a surprising Oiler team as captain into the NHL Stanley Cup Finals in 2006. Last two seasons of his career he spent in Philadelphia and Ottawa.

Aside from his World Junior gold medal experience, Smith has gone on to represent his homeland at 2001 World Championships.",51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,18.0,1992.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3

The tall and strong defenseman has a unique combination of size and speed. He accelerates very well and at full speed there are few, if any, defenseman of such stature that can match Hedman. Furthermore, he has very good hockey sense which contributes to him usually being at the right place at the right moment.

Hedman’s puck skills are above average and he is very good at moving the puck into the offensive end in high speed. He is also quite shifty and creative and can stickhandle through heavy traffic. Offensively, he has a good shot, including a heavy slapper that he could, however, use more frequently. His passing game is also of high caliber.

As for his defensive game, he does not really play very physical. He is an aggressive player with an edge to his game, but likes to solve tricky situations with his hockey sense and stick work, rather than playing the body. His reach is impressive and provides him with a natural advantage over his opponents.

Next season he played the majority of the year with the Fredericton Canadiens of the AHL while also making his NHL debut, appearing in one game with Montreal Canadiens. The following season, he split time with Fredericton and Montreal. The 1996–97 season saw Wilkie make the Montreal Canadiens full-time, appearing in 61 games and scoring 15 points, both NHL career highs.

He was then traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning, but injuries would hamper Wilkie in his time with the new team. After two miserable seasons he signed with the New York Rangers, but again ended up playing the majority of the time in the minors.

For the 2001–02 season, Wilkie signed with the Augusta Lynx of the ECHL as a player-coach. After one season with the Lynx, Wilkie retired as a player in 2002. Since then he works as a coach mainly for junior teams.",51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,20.0,1992.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4
