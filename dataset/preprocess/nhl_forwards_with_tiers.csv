He was a tricky stickhandler who protected the puck well but he lacked explosiveness in his skating to really surprise defenses. He did have a penetrating shot but too often he shot from too far out. Defensively he struggled with consistency but shook off early-career criticisms to be an average player without the puck. His poor face-off proficiency was a concern, however.
Overall, Arnason was a skilled center with good vision and offensive ability, but would consistently fail to show discipline and motivation in order to really make it as a professional hockey player.

Sven Andrighetto is an offensive forward with very good speed. Owns strong offensive instincts and has a nose for the net. Possesses decent puck skills and very good vision, as he sees the ice well and can create scoring chances for his teammates. Andrighetto plays a reliable two-way game and competes hard for the puck at both ends of the ice. Needs to get stronger in order to stand his ground along the boards, as he has still plenty of room to bulk up. Is a versatile player, who can line-up as center or wing.",32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.0,86.0,2013.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4

Has tremendous puck control and handles the puck with finesse, while rushing up the ice or deking past the opponents defense. Needs to improve his shot, although accurate it's missing power. He also lacks confidence in his face-off play, regardless of his excellent puck-skills. Not overly flashy, but he reaches good top-end speed by keeping his legs moving. Can guide a Power Play and despite his small stature will stand his ground, when he has to battle along the boards.",28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.0,102.0,2015.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4

An electric offensive presence on the ice, Casey Mittelstadt brings the complete package of speed, skill, and hockey sense. He competes hard with every shift, and has the dynamic puck skills to keep up with his creativity, which is a hallmark of his game. His awareness is all-encompassing, and he never puts his teammates in positions where their time and space will be bottlenecked. Bigger players don't phase him, as he thinks the game analytically and will find chinks in the opposition's armor on the fly. As a result, Mittelstadt is often seen forcing more complicated plays that the opposition won't be able to read in time.

Josh Anderson is a two-way forward with a rare combination of size and quickness. Possesses excellent foot-speed and has tremendous acceleration. With that asset he plays the game with very good drive and uses his speed to be an effective fore-checker and completes his hits well. Handles the puck well, granting puck-control is average, as he loves to dump the puck and chase it, instead of going 1-on-1 with a stickhandle-move. Has a nose for the net and creates scoring-chances for him and his teammates, although he is not known for his finishing-qualities. His speed, physical play and willingness to go to the front of the net and to the corners makes him the perfect player in a middle-6 role and can be used in all situations.",31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.0,95.0,2012.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3

He brings versatility, being able to play as a center or a winger, as well as elite skill and agility. His athleticism is exemplified in his strong skating that allows him to backcheck hard, explode up the ice in-transition, or propel himself up into hits that opponents won't soon forget. His defensive zone play is excellent; he proactively finds and takes away shooting and passing lanes, and makes it tough on opponents to pinpoint any daylight. When he is on the ice, he is uncontainable and leads the forecheck; he creates the time and space for himself to be creative with the puck and finds a way to get it to the back of the net. He makes the players around him better, serving as an example of what hard work and skill can and will be able to produce.

A similarly punishing two-way forward with size and zero deficiencies, Anze Kopitar, is the type of player Dubois will aspire to become at the next level. Pierre-Luc Dubois has the potential to develop into an elite two-way forward who excels as a positive catalyst in every facet of the roles he can play, be it the dynamic scorer, the set-up man, the intimidating power forward, or the defensive-minded shutdown guy.

He was tried on both wings, and was quoted saying he liked the left side better but he could play right wing easily if needed. A player known for his hard work and dedication to the game, as well as his consistently good attitude towards player growth and teaching. Stillman had battled injuries in last years, with surgeries on both shoulders, both knees and he suffered a concussion.

Not soon after, Nazarov moved to North America, which suited his style more than in the skill-dominated Russian league. Nazarov did not become an NHL regular right away and he had to spend a few seasons splitting his time between San Jose and Kansas City. But once Nazarov established himself as an NHL player, his presence was certainly felt all throughout the league. He developed into perhaps the best Russian enforcer the NHL has seen. Never shy to give his opinion, or drop his gloves, he was also no stranger to the penalty box. Nazarov played a pure Canadian game, and the Russians were proud to have someone in the league who did not fit the typical ""Euro-soft"" player stereotype.
In 2004, he returned to Russia where he played for Metallurg Novokuznetsk and Avangard Omsk. On and off-ice incidents, however, forced him back to North America where he skated three more games.
His retirement came shortly after claims from Nazarov that a large number of NHL players use performance-enhancing drugs. Realizing the consequences of his comments, he accepted his fate and retired.

Internationally, he represented Russia in 1998 World championship. After retirement he became succesful coach, both on club and international level. His hot-tempered personality is still present and Nazarov had several conflicts even as a coach.",51,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,10.0,1992.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3

Marc Savard was selected 91st overall in 1995 after leading the OHL with 139 points. He led the league again in 1997 with 130 points and won the OHL Championship with the Oshawa Generals.

Alexei Kovalev is a world class stick- and puck-handler. Can easily beat defenders in tight space with his terrific one-on-one moves in combination with his great and smooth skill-set. He is an elegant skater, but has lost a step or two over the years, although he’s still moves forward in an effective way. His wrist shot is hard and accurate and Alexei Kovalev has excellent vision and playmaking abilities. He knows exactly which games count and which not; however, critics have questioned his work ethic throughout his career.",52,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,15.0,1991.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1

Bäckström stands out with his tremendous hockey sense and soft hands. His technical skills are very good and one of his trademarks is the way he moves the puck into the offensive zone. He stickhandles really well through traffic. Offensively his passing skills are superb. His flip passes are perhaps a bit risky, His shot is decent, although it can and should be improved, and although he is still more of a playmaker than a scorer, he has a pretty good scoring touch.

Defensively Bäckström takes care of his responsibilities and is a rather good penalty killer. He could use some work on his conditioning and skating. Not slow by any means, but there is some room for improvement. Bäckström is not an overly physical player, but he is pretty strong and tough to knock the puck off.",37,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,4.0,2006.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,2

He is a smallish player at about 5’9, but compensates this by having high-class acceleration and top speed along with amazing balance. Furthermore, he is also known for his excellent technical skills and willingness to challenge his opponents. A very spectacular player when he stickhandles through traffic. Hockey sense is good and he also plays with grit and is not afraid to lay a hit, despite his physical shortcomings.

Offensively, he knows how to find the net and is a capable scorer, but also a fairly skilled playmaker. In his own end, Tedenby should work with his backchecking and defensive play overall, as he sometimes is too offensive minded. Also, his physical game would be improved even more if he added more muscles and strength.",35,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1.0,24.0,2008.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4

He knows how to get under the skin of opponents and will actively seek out opportunities to lay the body and create separation, all the while staying attentive to the unfolding play. This unique aspect of his game makes him difficult and frustrating to play against.

His ability to finish and create plays is undoubtedly the hallmark of his game, as he is one of the major dynamos of his draft class. He is a dangerous scoring threat anywhere below the blue line and his vision matched with his net-drive propels him into positions that create high percentage opportunities. Defensively astute and proactive, he sees the lanes that his opponents do and will do his best to force the puck along the wall where he is at his best.

Cousins: Oliver Lindholm, Elias Lindholm

A very skilled center that will get the job done on the wing as well. Järnkrok's main asset is his outstanding hockey sense, which allows him to be the great playmaker that he is. Overall a very smart player with good positioning in all zones. Also quite shifty with soft hands and impressive puckhandling skills. Not a physical player, but plays pretty well through heavy traffic although in need of gaining strength and muscles. Good character.

He was an offensively productive centreman whose style of play was well suited to international hockey. Had plenty of creativity and fine hands. After the draft, Petrovicky moved across the Atlantic to try his hand at North American style hockey. His transition, however, fell far short of expectations. Over the decade that followed, he never played in one place for an entire season. His NHL stints were usually annual but brief in nature. In essence, he was unable to adapt his scoring touch to the NHL level. He was useful to teams in a pinch, but otherwise he was, for the most part, a minor-league call-up. After his return to Europe he played in many countries including Swtzerland, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Czech republic and Slovakia. Overall he was a great leader and often named captain. He was the last former Hartford Whalers player active in professional hockey.

He played in three Olympic games and five World Championships, winning gold medal in 2002.

He tried to have his contract renegotiated three times in five years when he played with the Senators. He sat out the 1998-99 season over a contract dispute. He became the first Russian to be the full-time captain of an NHL team. He spent 12 seasons in NHL and moved back to Russia in 2007 after being bought out of the Islanders contract, where he continued his career. Even after retirement in 2012, he was still being paid by Islanders until 2015. In December 2012, he was appointed to the post of general manager of the Russian National Women's Team.

He exploits gaps in the neutral zone; his positioning allows him to carry the puck forward immediately or shift up and into stride off of an outlet pass. He promptly takes easy lanes away from the opposition along his own blue line, but could stand to be more proactive defensively. Offensively, he might be described as uncontainable: the confidence he has in his individual puck skill, paired with a high level of thinking, makes him a difficult cog to take out of alignment. He is able to create opportunities for himself, as well as teammates, out of nothing; this, in turn, translates to energy on the ice and in the building as a whole.

The Russian Rocket was one of the fastest skaters and greatest goal scorers to ever touch the ice. Bure won gold at the World Juniors and World Championship and set the WJC tournament record with 27 goals in 21 games. He won the Calder Trophy in 1992 with 34 goals and 60 points in 65 games and followed up with 2 straight 60-goal seasons, the latter of which led the NHL. Bure helped lead the Canucks to the 1994 Cup Finals with 16 goals and 31 points in the playoffs but fell short in a 3-2 Game 7 loss. After 51 goals in 1998, he was traded to the Panthers, where he won back-to-back Maurice Richard Trophies with 58 goals in 2000 and 59 in 2001. The 6x All-Star retired in 2003 with 437 goals and 779 points in 702 games, the 5th highest goals per game rate in NHL history.",54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,6.0,113.0,1989.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

Yzerman was fantastic one-on-one with defensemen, using his terrific stickhandling skills and tremendous skating abilities. Had a laser of a shot, and was an awesome playmaker and passer.

Once a pure offensive force, Scotty Bowman turned him into an outstanding two-way center and an amazing defensive forward as well. To achieve this, Yzerman had to sacrifice a lot of personal stats and instead improve the team.

A quiet player, Yzerman is famous for his ""lead-by-example"" style of leadership.",60,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,4.0,1983.0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,1,1,1,3,1
