He was 20 when he came to the NHL and immediately established himself as one of the most punishing body-checkers in professional hockey. He was extremely unpopular with opponents, who could be seen emerging from encounters in the corners with Kasparaitis in a state of sheer rage. During his career, the hard-hitting Kasparaitis has suffered at least as much pain as he has inflicted on others. A strong skater who mostly concentrated on the defensive side of the game, Kasparaitis had an infectious enthusiasm for the game. He left the NHL in 2007 and played two more seasons for SKA St. Petersburg in the KHL before retiring as a professional player. But after four years without official hockey games he came back. In 2013 he made his formal transfer back to Lithuania and joined the Hockey Punks Vilnius. He has played four consecutive seasons in the top Lithuanian league. In his playing days he was known as a big spender, blowing his high paychecks on clothes and cars and nights out. But he has settled down and started his own real estate development company.

In 1992 during the split up he stayed with the Russian system, won Olympic gold with the ""Unified Team"", he represented Russia in the World Championship as he did in 1996, at three more Olympic Winter Games (1998, 2002, 2006) and the 2004 World Cup of Hockey."

Defensively he struggled with consistency but shook off early-career criticisms to be an average player without the puck. His poor face-off proficiency was a concern, however.
Overall, Arnason was a skilled center with good vision and offensive ability, but would consistently fail to show discipline and motivation in order to really make it as a professional hockey player.

His awareness is all-encompassing, and he never puts his teammates in positions where their time and space will be bottlenecked. Bigger players don't phase him, as he thinks the game analytically and will find chinks in the opposition's armor on the fly. As a result, Mittelstadt is often seen forcing more complicated plays that the opposition won't be able to read in time. On top of all this, he can play a north-south game, and his transition game is already at an elite level. He's a complete player with the predatory instincts necessary to succeed as a consistent and, perhaps, dominant point producer at the next level."

His mobility is all but elite at this point; he primarily uses his speed to open up passing and shooting lanes in the offensive zone. With and without the puck he stays composed and in-position, allowing him to analyze situations effortlessly and make those calculated decisions. Defensively, he is assertive and, though he isn't able to impose himself physically, he uses his vision and quickness to take away options and put pressure on the opposition. He plays a structured game offensively, and he does the little things right. His ability to recognize where the puck is, where it is going to be, and why it is going to be there is an indicator of his high-level hockey sense. When you put together skill, speed, and excellent decision-making as well as he does, that translates to on-ice productivity and power-play time. All-in-all, Nicolas Beaudin is an offensive defenceman that understands his own game well and ever seeks to expand upon his strengths."

Brothers: Jordan Anderson & Jake Anderson
Great Uncle: Pete Mahovlich

Josh Anderson is a two-way forward with a rare combination of size and quickness. Possesses excellent foot-speed and has tremendous acceleration. With that asset he plays the game with very good drive and uses his speed to be an effective fore-checker and completes his hits well. Handles the puck well, granting puck-control is average, as he loves to dump the puck and chase it, instead of going 1-on-1 with a stickhandle-move. Has a nose for the net and creates scoring-chances for him and his teammates, although he is not known for his finishing-qualities. His speed, physical play and willingness to go to the front of the net and to the corners makes him the perfect player in a middle-6 role and can be used in all situations."

His defensive zone play is excellent; he proactively finds and takes away shooting and passing lanes, and makes it tough on opponents to pinpoint any daylight. When he is on the ice, he is uncontainable and leads the forecheck; he creates the time and space for himself to be creative with the puck and finds a way to get it to the back of the net.

He was tried on both wings, and was quoted saying he liked the left side better but he could play right wing easily if needed. A player known for his hard work and dedication to the game, as well as his consistently good attitude towards player growth and teaching. Stillman had battled injuries in last years, with surgeries on both shoulders, both knees and he suffered a concussion.

Stillman was a gritty player on the ice, playing in 1,025 games and becoming one of only six players in history to win the Stanley Cup in consecutive seasons for different teams. Stillman won his first Cup with Tampa Bay in 2004 before signing with Carolina after the lockout that wiped out the 2004-05 season ended. Stillman's Hurricanes won the Cup in 2006.

However, the loss of the 2004–05 NHL season due to a lockout nullified his attempt at a return to hockey that year. Girard played one game with Providence in the AHL on October 15, 2005, before returning to Quebec to consult with his doctors.

Not soon after, Nazarov moved to North America, which suited his style more than in the skill-dominated Russian league. Nazarov did not become an NHL regular right away and he had to spend a few seasons splitting his time between San Jose and Kansas City. But once Nazarov established himself as an NHL player, his presence was certainly felt all throughout the league. He developed into perhaps the best Russian enforcer the NHL has seen. Never shy to give his opinion, or drop his gloves, he was also no stranger to the penalty box. Nazarov played a pure Canadian game, and the Russians were proud to have someone in the league who did not fit the typical ""Euro-soft"" player stereotype.
In 2004, he returned to Russia where he played for Metallurg Novokuznetsk and Avangard Omsk. On and off-ice incidents, however, forced him back to North America where he skated three more games.
His retirement came shortly after claims from Nazarov that a large number of NHL players use performance-enhancing drugs. Realizing the consequences of his comments, he accepted his fate and retired.

Internationally, he represented Russia in 1998 World championship. After retirement he became succesful coach, both on club and international level. His hot-tempered personality is still present and Nazarov had several conflicts even as a coach."

Even so, there were warning signs. Hulbig played just 17 games of high school hockey in his draft year – a shoulder injury knocked him out of the lineup – and that represented two problems. The first was that Hulbig didn’t play very much, reducing the number of times scouts could see him. The second was that Hulbig was playing at a terrible level, making judgement difficult. He was slated for college hockey, joining Providence following the draft.

Almost immediately, the Oilers must have known there was a problem. In his first year at Providence, Hulbig scored just three times and finished with 16 points in 26 games. Hulbig did pick up the pace eventually, scoring at the point-per-game level over his final two seasons. He’d earn a few NHL cups of coffee over the ensuing years thanks to strong play in the minors. The problem, though, was that he was essentially finished developing offensively at the age of 23.

On November 9, 2000 he suffered a career-threatening head injury. During his recovery, it was also determined that nagging abdominal injuries required significant surgery. He eventually came back, but never returned to NHL, finishing his career in the minors being only 31 years old."

Despite his immense talent, Gonchar never won a Norris Trophy as the NHL’s best defenseman; the closest he ever got was finishing fourth in voting three times.

Overall, Gonchar was an offensively skilled defenseman with an excellent eye for the game. A good skater with good stickhandling. Had a good opening pass and was generally a good passer. He was a lethal weapon on the power play, a world class player and also played sound defense. With a devastating wrist shot and smooth skating skills, he liked to shoot from the blue line, but he was never very physical player.

Gonchar is a two-time Olympic medal-winner with Russia. He earned a silver medal at the 1998 Olympic Games and a bronze medal at the 2002 Olympic Games. In addition, Gonchar also competed in the 1993 World Junior Championship, two World Cups and three World Championships."

Not afraid to lay the body, or take a hit to make the play; can and will stand up for teammates. Possesses good hands and awareness on the ice, as well as a hard shot that is quite accurate. All-in-all, a complete defenseman that is relied upon to offset any oncoming attacks, as well as create chances in the opposing end. (Curtis Joe, EP 2015)

Could end up being that home-run pick in the 2015 NHL Draft. Few holes in his game. A low-risk, high-reward type of player. Reminiscent style of play to that of NHL D-man Keith Yandle. [EP]

Won the National Championship of 6th, 7th, 8th grade players and Czech U16 with HC Kometa Brno."

Warriner is also notable for having scored the first goal in the history of the then newly opened Air Canada Centre on February 20, 1999 as a member of the home Toronto Maple Leafs.

He has the competitiveness and drive to do whatever it takes to win, and that is key to his success as a versatile scoring winger."

Known more for his gritty play, Smith continued to be one of the teams leaders both on and off the ice. He was always ready to drop the gloves and stand up for his teammates, although he was not a heavyweight fighter. He was never a top scorer, but his presence in a locker room was very important.

Offensively, below the opposition's blue line, he is an electric, dominant force that showcases excellent decision-making and undeniable puck skills. He's aggressive, but never takes stupid penalties that will put his team in disadvantage state.

He was an offensively productive centreman whose style of play was well suited to international hockey. Had plenty of creativity and fine hands. After the draft, Petrovicky moved across the Atlantic to try his hand at North American style hockey. His transition, however, fell far short of expectations. Over the decade that followed, he never played in one place for an entire season. His NHL stints were usually annual but brief in nature. In essence, he was unable to adapt his scoring touch to the NHL level. He was useful to teams in a pinch, but otherwise he was, for the most part, a minor-league call-up. After his return to Europe he played in many countries including Swtzerland, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Czech republic and Slovakia. Overall he was a great leader and often named captain. He was the last former Hartford Whalers player active in professional hockey.

He played in three Olympic games and five World Championships, winning gold medal in 2002.

He tried to have his contract renegotiated three times in five years when he played with the Senators. He sat out the 1998-99 season over a contract dispute. He became the first Russian to be the full-time captain of an NHL team. He spent 12 seasons in NHL and moved back to Russia in 2007 after being bought out of the Islanders contract, where he continued his career. Even after retirement in 2012, he was still being paid by Islanders until 2015. In December 2012, he was appointed to the post of general manager of the Russian National Women's Team.

On the international stage, the former first rounder is a two-time member of Russia's Olympic team (1998 and 2002), a seven-time member of its World Championship team (1993, 1994, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2004 and 2005), two-time member of its World Junior team (1992, 1993) and a two-time member of its World Cup team."

Offensively, he might be described as uncontainable: the confidence he has in his individual puck skill, paired with a high level of thinking, makes him a difficult cog to take out of alignment.

Hedman’s puck skills are above average and he is very good at moving the puck into the offensive end in high speed. He is also quite shifty and creative and can stickhandle through heavy traffic. Offensively, he has a good shot, including a heavy slapper that he could, however, use more frequently. His passing game is also of high caliber.

As for his defensive game, he does not really play very physical. He is an aggressive player with an edge to his game, but likes to solve tricky situations with his hockey sense and stick work, rather than playing the body. His reach is impressive and provides him with a natural advantage over his opponents.

However, lack of opportunities from NHL teams, injuries and very early retirement never allowed him to fulfill his potential. The following season after the draft, Wilkie returned to the WHL and made his international debut representing the United States in the 1993 WJC. Next season he played the majority of the year with the Fredericton Canadiens of the AHL while also making his NHL debut, appearing in one game with Montreal Canadiens. The following season, he split time with Fredericton and Montreal. The 1996–97 season saw Wilkie make the Montreal Canadiens full-time, appearing in 61 games and scoring 15 points, both NHL career highs.

He was then traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning, but injuries would hamper Wilkie in his time with the new team. After two miserable seasons he signed with the New York Rangers, but again ended up playing the majority of the time in the minors.

For the 2001–02 season, Wilkie signed with the Augusta Lynx of the ECHL as a player-coach. After one season with the Lynx, Wilkie retired as a player in 2002. Since then he works as a coach mainly for junior teams."

A deft and agile skater, he exhibits explosive mobility both up and down the ice. In all three zones, he proactively looks to create problems for the opposition. His awareness is indicative of his high level of hockey sense, and he knows how to make plays and scoring chances materialize. Has a goal scorer's toolbox, complete with the individual puck skills that one comes to expect from today's elite offensive players. The accurate release on his shot is noteworthy and is a defining aspect of his offensive capabilities. Defensively sound, he disrupts lanes and pressures the opposition to make hasty decisions; he is tenacious in pursuit of puck control and transitions up-ice naturally. All-in-all, Zadina can be categorized as both a two-way forward with a well-rounded game and a dominant offensive force."

He's a hard-nosed workhorse that makes the players around him better.

He sees the ice well and is rarely caught out of position. His defensive game is refined and he actively pursues puck control. Transitioning to offence is natural, smooth, and quick. All-in-all, a well-rounded two-way forward that skates well and can be the catalyst a team needs to turn a game in its favor.
