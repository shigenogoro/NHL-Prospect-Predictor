He was 20 when he came to the NHL and immediately established himself as one of the most punishing body-checkers in professional hockey. He was extremely unpopular with opponents, who could be seen emerging from encounters in the corners with Kasparaitis in a state of sheer rage. During his career, the hard-hitting Kasparaitis has suffered at least as much pain as he has inflicted on others. A strong skater who mostly concentrated on the defensive side of the game, Kasparaitis had an infectious enthusiasm for the game. He left the NHL in 2007 and played two more seasons for SKA St. Petersburg in the KHL before retiring as a professional player. But after four years without official hockey games he came back. In 2013 he made his formal transfer back to Lithuania and joined the Hockey Punks Vilnius. He has played four consecutive seasons in the top Lithuanian league. In his playing days he was known as a big spender, blowing his high paychecks on clothes and cars and nights out. But he has settled down and started his own real estate development company.

In 1992 during the split up he stayed with the Russian system, won Olympic gold with the ""Unified Team"", he represented Russia in the World Championship as he did in 1996, at three more Olympic Winter Games (1998, 2002, 2006) and the 2004 World Cup of Hockey."

Not soon after, Nazarov moved to North America, which suited his style more than in the skill-dominated Russian league. Nazarov did not become an NHL regular right away and he had to spend a few seasons splitting his time between San Jose and Kansas City. But once Nazarov established himself as an NHL player, his presence was certainly felt all throughout the league. He developed into perhaps the best Russian enforcer the NHL has seen. Never shy to give his opinion, or drop his gloves, he was also no stranger to the penalty box. Nazarov played a pure Canadian game, and the Russians were proud to have someone in the league who did not fit the typical ""Euro-soft"" player stereotype.
In 2004, he returned to Russia where he played for Metallurg Novokuznetsk and Avangard Omsk. On and off-ice incidents, however, forced him back to North America where he skated three more games.
His retirement came shortly after claims from Nazarov that a large number of NHL players use performance-enhancing drugs. Realizing the consequences of his comments, he accepted his fate and retired.

Internationally, he represented Russia in 1998 World championship. After retirement he became succesful coach, both on club and international level. His hot-tempered personality is still present and Nazarov had several conflicts even as a coach."

However, lack of opportunities from NHL teams, injuries and very early retirement never allowed him to fulfill his potential. The following season after the draft, Wilkie returned to the WHL and made his international debut representing the United States in the 1993 WJC. Next season he played the majority of the year with the Fredericton Canadiens of the AHL while also making his NHL debut, appearing in one game with Montreal Canadiens. The following season, he split time with Fredericton and Montreal. The 1996–97 season saw Wilkie make the Montreal Canadiens full-time, appearing in 61 games and scoring 15 points, both NHL career highs.

He was then traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning, but injuries would hamper Wilkie in his time with the new team. After two miserable seasons he signed with the New York Rangers, but again ended up playing the majority of the time in the minors.

For the 2001–02 season, Wilkie signed with the Augusta Lynx of the ECHL as a player-coach. After one season with the Lynx, Wilkie retired as a player in 2002. Since then he works as a coach mainly for junior teams."

Even so, there were warning signs. Hulbig played just 17 games of high school hockey in his draft year – a shoulder injury knocked him out of the lineup – and that represented two problems. The first was that Hulbig didn’t play very much, reducing the number of times scouts could see him. The second was that Hulbig was playing at a terrible level, making judgement difficult. He was slated for college hockey, joining Providence following the draft.

Almost immediately, the Oilers must have known there was a problem. In his first year at Providence, Hulbig scored just three times and finished with 16 points in 26 games. Hulbig did pick up the pace eventually, scoring at the point-per-game level over his final two seasons. He’d earn a few NHL cups of coffee over the ensuing years thanks to strong play in the minors. The problem, though, was that he was essentially finished developing offensively at the age of 23.

On November 9, 2000 he suffered a career-threatening head injury. During his recovery, it was also determined that nagging abdominal injuries required significant surgery. He eventually came back, but never returned to NHL, finishing his career in the minors being only 31 years old."

Over the decade that followed, he never played in one place for an entire season. His NHL stints were usually annual but brief in nature. In essence, he was unable to adapt his scoring touch to the NHL level. He was useful to teams in a pinch, but otherwise he was, for the most part, a minor-league call-up.

The tall and strong defenseman has a unique combination of size and speed. He accelerates very well and at full speed there are few, if any, defenseman of such stature that can match Hedman. Furthermore, he has very good hockey sense which contributes to him usually being at the right place at the right moment.

Hedman’s puck skills are above average and he is very good at moving the puck into the offensive end in high speed. He is also quite shifty and creative and can stickhandle through heavy traffic. Offensively, he has a good shot, including a heavy slapper that he could, however, use more frequently. His passing game is also of high caliber.

As for his defensive game, he does not really play very physical. He is an aggressive player with an edge to his game, but likes to solve tricky situations with his hockey sense and stick work, rather than playing the body. His reach is impressive and provides him with a natural advantage over his opponents. What really characterizes Hedman as a player, beside the obvious combination of size, skill and speed, is his attitude, winner’s instinct and the urge to be the best at what he does."

Uses his size well, but needs to be more consistently physical overall. Makes well thought-through decisions, yet is not all too quick in making them. When he makes that mind-body connection in-game, he comes through as an impact player who is hard to play against at both ends of the ice."

His brother Matthew died in the same incident.

""Johnny Hockey"" was a diminutive, offensively dominant winger with an incredibly high level of skill. Possessed the elusiveness to avoid being taken out, and the creativity to start and finish plays. Exhibited incredible puck control, strength on his skates, stickhandling ability, and a very good forehand and backhand shot which was off of his stick in the blink of an eye. All-in-all, the prototypical offensive winger who could put up points, and be relied upon to create scoring chances, whenever he was on the ice."
Adam Almquist,Sweden,D,181,79,L,,,"('7', '210', '2009')","['1-time TV-Pucken Gold Medal', '1-time AHL Calder Cup Champion', '1-time AHL Second All-Star Team', '1-time NL Champion', '2-time SHL Champion']","A puck-moving defenseman, Almquist has top-notch hockey sense and passing ability. Has the ability to turn the game quickly with long and distinct passes. Puts up a lot of points from the blueline, where his set-up ability comes in handy.

However, Almquist could seek to improve his mobility. Although being undersized, he likes to play the body at times, but his game would improve with better size and strength."
Matt Carey,Canada,W/C,185,88,L,,,,[],"Matt Carey is a two-way forward who can play either wing or center. Has some playmaking ability as well as grit. Could use some extra bulk to improve physically.

He has a hard shot from the point, lays open ice hits and uses his premier size all over the ice. He's an average skater, but can rush the puck."

Has decent offensive qualities, such as his shot, but is at his best in the defensive zone."
Mike Zalewski,USA,LW/C,188,93,L,,,,['1-time BCHL Champion'],"A reliable two-way forward that has a strong understanding of the game. Has the size to play a gritty, shutdown role and the skating to chase down the puck and win battles. Versatility is his strong suit and he tries to be a difference maker in whatever role he plays. Defensively, he plays a well-rounded game and will be the first to initiate contact. Creates separation well, but need to follow up on loose pucks and be quicker to action. Has the tools to be a key player in multiple roles."

Granberg plays a very solid defensive game and rarely gets caught out of position. He plays a simple and safe game with the puck. Does not shy away from the rough stuff, but could probably play even more physical. Hockey sense is decent, but Granberg will never be a high-scoring defenseman."
