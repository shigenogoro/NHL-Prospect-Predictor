He was extremely unpopular with opponents, who could be seen emerging from encounters in the corners with Kasparaitis in a state of sheer rage. During his career, the hard-hitting Kasparaitis has suffered at least as much pain as he has inflicted on others. A strong skater who mostly concentrated on the defensive side of the game, Kasparaitis had an infectious enthusiasm for the game. He left the NHL in 2007 and played two more seasons for SKA St. Petersburg in the KHL before retiring as a professional player. But after four years without official hockey games he came back. In 2013 he made his formal transfer back to Lithuania and joined the Hockey Punks Vilnius. He has played four consecutive seasons in the top Lithuanian league. In his playing days he was known as a big spender, blowing his high paychecks on clothes and cars and nights out. But he has settled down and started his own real estate development company.

In 1992 during the split up he stayed with the Russian system, won Olympic gold with the ""Unified Team"", he represented Russia in the World Championship as he did in 1996, at three more Olympic Winter Games (1998, 2002, 2006) and the 2004 World Cup of Hockey."

Bigger players don't phase him, as he thinks the game analytically and will find chinks in the opposition's armor on the fly. As a result, Mittelstadt is often seen forcing more complicated plays that the opposition won't be able to read in time. On top of all this, he can play a north-south game, and his transition game is already at an elite level.

Defensively, he is assertive and, though he isn't able to impose himself physically, he uses his vision and quickness to take away options and put pressure on the opposition. He plays a structured game offensively, and he does the little things right. His ability to recognize where the puck is, where it is going to be, and why it is going to be there is an indicator of his high-level hockey sense. When you put together skill, speed, and excellent decision-making as well as he does, that translates to on-ice productivity and power-play time. All-in-all, Nicolas Beaudin is an offensive defenceman that understands his own game well and ever seeks to expand upon his strengths."

Bertuzzi skates with an excellent awareness of position, and his stride is wide to let him cut across lanes at difficult angles to read. His positioning is top-notch, and his offensive skill is undeniable, as he is an adept finisher as well as a creative playmaker.

Josh Anderson is a two-way forward with a rare combination of size and quickness. Possesses excellent foot-speed and has tremendous acceleration. With that asset he plays the game with very good drive and uses his speed to be an effective fore-checker and completes his hits well. Handles the puck well, granting puck-control is average, as he loves to dump the puck and chase it, instead of going 1-on-1 with a stickhandle-move. Has a nose for the net and creates scoring-chances for him and his teammates, although he is not known for his finishing-qualities.

His defensive zone play is excellent; he proactively finds and takes away shooting and passing lanes, and makes it tough on opponents to pinpoint any daylight.

Not soon after, Nazarov moved to North America, which suited his style more than in the skill-dominated Russian league. Nazarov did not become an NHL regular right away and he had to spend a few seasons splitting his time between San Jose and Kansas City. But once Nazarov established himself as an NHL player, his presence was certainly felt all throughout the league. He developed into perhaps the best Russian enforcer the NHL has seen. Never shy to give his opinion, or drop his gloves, he was also no stranger to the penalty box. Nazarov played a pure Canadian game, and the Russians were proud to have someone in the league who did not fit the typical ""Euro-soft"" player stereotype.
In 2004, he returned to Russia where he played for Metallurg Novokuznetsk and Avangard Omsk. On and off-ice incidents, however, forced him back to North America where he skated three more games.
His retirement came shortly after claims from Nazarov that a large number of NHL players use performance-enhancing drugs. Realizing the consequences of his comments, he accepted his fate and retired.

Internationally, he represented Russia in 1998 World championship. After retirement he became succesful coach, both on club and international level. His hot-tempered personality is still present and Nazarov had several conflicts even as a coach."

Even so, there were warning signs. Hulbig played just 17 games of high school hockey in his draft year – a shoulder injury knocked him out of the lineup – and that represented two problems. The first was that Hulbig didn’t play very much, reducing the number of times scouts could see him. The second was that Hulbig was playing at a terrible level, making judgement difficult. He was slated for college hockey, joining Providence following the draft.

Almost immediately, the Oilers must have known there was a problem. In his first year at Providence, Hulbig scored just three times and finished with 16 points in 26 games. Hulbig did pick up the pace eventually, scoring at the point-per-game level over his final two seasons. He’d earn a few NHL cups of coffee over the ensuing years thanks to strong play in the minors. The problem, though, was that he was essentially finished developing offensively at the age of 23.

On November 9, 2000 he suffered a career-threatening head injury. During his recovery, it was also determined that nagging abdominal injuries required significant surgery. He eventually came back, but never returned to NHL, finishing his career in the minors being only 31 years old."

Could end up being that home-run pick in the 2015 NHL Draft. Few holes in his game. A low-risk, high-reward type of player. Reminiscent style of play to that of NHL D-man Keith Yandle. [EP]

Won the National Championship of 6th, 7th, 8th grade players and Czech U16 with HC Kometa Brno."

He had a good shot and made smart first pass, but was never an overly creative offensive player. He became an in-demand player as a veteran because of his savvy and calm play. He would often be brought into a new team to play a leader's role and help young prospects like he once was.

Offensively, below the opposition's blue line, he is an electric, dominant force that showcases excellent decision-making and undeniable puck skills.

Over the decade that followed, he never played in one place for an entire season. His NHL stints were usually annual but brief in nature. In essence, he was unable to adapt his scoring touch to the NHL level. He was useful to teams in a pinch, but otherwise he was, for the most part, a minor-league call-up. After his return to Europe he played in many countries including Swtzerland, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Czech republic and Slovakia. Overall he was a great leader and often named captain. He was the last former Hartford Whalers player active in professional hockey.

He played in three Olympic games and five World Championships, winning gold medal in 2002.

However, lack of opportunities from NHL teams, injuries and very early retirement never allowed him to fulfill his potential. The following season after the draft, Wilkie returned to the WHL and made his international debut representing the United States in the 1993 WJC. Next season he played the majority of the year with the Fredericton Canadiens of the AHL while also making his NHL debut, appearing in one game with Montreal Canadiens. The following season, he split time with Fredericton and Montreal. The 1996–97 season saw Wilkie make the Montreal Canadiens full-time, appearing in 61 games and scoring 15 points, both NHL career highs.

He was then traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning, but injuries would hamper Wilkie in his time with the new team. After two miserable seasons he signed with the New York Rangers, but again ended up playing the majority of the time in the minors.

For the 2001–02 season, Wilkie signed with the Augusta Lynx of the ECHL as a player-coach. After one season with the Lynx, Wilkie retired as a player in 2002. Since then he works as a coach mainly for junior teams."
